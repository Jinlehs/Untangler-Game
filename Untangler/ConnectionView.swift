//1. a closure when the thing is moved slightly
//2. a closure when the things finished dragging
//3. where they started touching the view - this is so that when a user is tapping and has skinny fingers, the dragging will start at the point of contact rather than the middle, becasue if it centralizes whenever we touch it would have a weird movage
